# Testing

If you have found yourself here, that means you would like to test the Sleepy-Duck.

If you desire to test it out, I use Docker container to test the Sleepy-Duck.

## Compatibility with OS

So far, I have the following versions ready to work: 

- Debian based

I will be working to include:

- CentOS and RedHat Enterprise
- Windows
- FreeBSD

## How to test

To test the environment, you would need the following tools: 

- <a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker</a>
- any OS
- access to `root`

To download required dependencies you can go ahead and download Docker OR you can run `install_docker.sh` script. It's up to you.
